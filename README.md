# Matthew Davis Web Development Portfolio Page

#### Link of deployment:

https://MaDCodingPower.github.io/PortfolioPage/


## Description

My name is Matthew Davis and this is my portfolio page. It is used to highlight my recent and more impressive projects, and also briefly tell people
about me and my life. It includes contact information as well, and has some cool features. More specifically, this page was a test of how I can
produce something that was pleasing to look at and had a few neat animations.

## How to Use

Simply look through and observe what the page has to offer. The header has a navigation bar that will lead you to different parts of the page by
auto scrolling you to them. There is a projects area, where youll find image links to deployed projects I have recently made. At the bottom, there 
is a contact me section. Clicking on either the icon or the link associated with said icon will direct you to a contact avenue or an associated 
social media account of mine.
