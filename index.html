                    <p>My name is Matthew. I am and have been a fine-dining bartender and server for many years now. With how volatile the
                        the economy is nowadays, I have decided it would be a good idea to change career paths to something I have wanted
                        to learn for many years now. I have no prior experience coding other than this bootcamp through UW, and have been
                        very happy with my progress and how much I am learning. I look forward to the potential career change and betterment
                        of life! Cheers to us all.
